## Overview:
- `./PlotsGaussianMixtures/` ...
- `./gamma/` ...
- `./2D_histograms/` contains all 90 histograms of every marker conditioned on every fluid pair. For example, `distributions_of_ALAS2.pdf` contains the histogram of ALAS2 (a marker) values conditioned on all six fluid pairs present in `mixtures.csv`. As a result, this file contains six different histograms.
- `./3D_histograms/` contains the 3D histograms of highly-correlative marker pairs for the fluid pair blood and menstrual secretion. For example, `(Blood,Menstrual.secretion)_distribution_of_(CYP2B7P1,MMP7).pdf` illustrates the 3D histogram of the values of markers CYP2B7P1 and MMP7 for this fluid pair.
