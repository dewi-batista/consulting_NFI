## Overview:

`./gamma/`
- Contains a folder for each fluid pair in which plots of both the best fit Gamma mixture model as well as the data generated by said model are present.

`./gaussian/`
- Contains two directories, one for the best fit Gaussian mixture model for each fluid pair and the other for the data generated by said models. In the generated data plots, the leave-out dataset used to perform the KS test is also illustrated.

`./histograms/2D_individual_markers/`
- Contains all 90 histograms of every marker conditioned on every fluid pair. For example, `distributions_of_ALAS2.pdf` contains the histogram of ALAS2 (a marker) values conditioned on all six fluid pairs present in `mixtures.csv`. As a result, this file contains six different histograms.

`./histograms/3D_paired_correlating_markers/`
- Contains the 3D histograms of highly-correlative marker pairs for the fluid pair blood and menstrual secretion. For example, `(Blood,Menstrual.secretion)_distribution_of_(CYP2B7P1,MMP7).pdf` illustrates the 3D histogram of the values of markers CYP2B7P1 and MMP7 for this fluid pair.
